Java Security for CodeSup
=========================

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/codesup/java-security.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/codesup/java-security)

**Java Security** is a security engine for running untrusted code in a save environment. It's created to run on [Heroku](http://heroku.com) and intended to secure user classes for [CodeSup](http://codesup.com).
