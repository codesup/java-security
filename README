This is the java-security for gamboo.
In the Folder "Java Security" is a eclipse project where you can test everything in the class: Evil.MyCode.

At this time it's only a alpha version because in the next time I will improve:
+ Documentation
+ Overflow problem
+ Loading classes over the classLoader
+ Every Object is a seperate process
+ better Exception-handling
